# Systematic screening of morphogen patterning in human neural organoids with multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics



Repository conitaning code used for the analysis in the [Sanchís-Calleja, Azbukina et al., 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.08.579413v1).
Repo has 4 folders, dedicated to morphogen patterning screen, morphogen reproducibility screen, morphoGRN analysis with SCENIC, and MiSTR.
